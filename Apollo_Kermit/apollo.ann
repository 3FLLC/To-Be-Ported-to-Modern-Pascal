Version 2.9 of the alternative Apollo Pascal Kermit (APX).
----------------------------------------------------------

The principal change between versions 2.7 and 2.9 of Apollo APX Kermit is to
add in the 8 bit quoting and associated file handling changes from APO
Kermit versions 2.8 and 2.8a.  In the parameters exchange, APX 2.9 also
handles 'Y' and 'N' in the 8-bit field from the other Kermit correctly.
Also there is now SET 8BIT ON/OFF (if ON, it sends '&' which, according to
the protocol manual, means "I insist on quoting" ; if OFF, it sends 'N'
which means "I can't").

I believe that the APX Kermit can now do everything that the APO version
does (and more).

The extensions are:

APX can be run on a remote node, even (crudely) from an attached terminal on
the local node.

            Repeat count processing.
            Filename normalising.
            RECEIVE followed by filename.
            SET TIME and TIMEOUT.

Other changes between 2.7 and 2.9.

CVT_NL is now called RAW (i.e. CVT_NL OFF now RAW ON).

This version works out how is is being driven and sets GRAPHICS and RAW
accordingly.  As before, if it is being driven by an sio line it assumes it
is running as a remote Kermit, so you can't use it as it stands to drive one
sio on a node from another.

If it is running on a remote node, CONNECT now works in RAW mode.  This
means you no longer get a double echo and echoing of passwords and you
can send control characters.  However, if you are using an attached
terminal on the local node, this doesn't work and you must explicitly
SET RAW OFF before CONNECTing.  If normalising, received file names are
converted to lower case.  Now handles prefixing in incoming fileheader
packets and does control quoting in outgoing ones. 

To avoid confusion, this version announces itself as Apollo-APX.  Minor code
changes to stop the Pascal optimiser generating warnings.

This version works under Aegis SR 9.7.  I don't know whether it works under
SR10 - but it will have to be made to eventually.
