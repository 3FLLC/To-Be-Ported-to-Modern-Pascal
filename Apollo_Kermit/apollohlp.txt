                Kermit Version 2.9 to run on the Apollo System
                ==============================================

     The following commands are implemented in the current version of Kermit
     running on the Apollo :

        Command                        Description
     ------------- --------------------------------------------------------
     CONNECT (C)   Establish a terminal connection to the system at the
                   other end of the communication line.

     EXIT    (E)   Exits the Kermit program.  Reset the I/O lines to their
                   original settings before Kermit was executed.

     FINISH  (F)   When running as a local Kermit talking to a remote
                   Kermit server use the FINISH command to shut down the
                   server without logging out the remote job, so that you
                   can CONNECT back to it.

     GET     (G)   Requests a remote Kermit server to send the file or
                   file group specified.

     HELP    (H)   Gives a brief list of commands and their function
                   (typing command-name ? gives further details).

     LOCAL   (LOC) Executes the specified command on the Apollo.  This
                   command is intended to provide local file management
                   capabilities without having to leave the Kermit
                   program.  Extreme caution must be used if attempting
                   to execute programs, especially those outside of the
                   current working directory.  When executing commands, if
                   the command is not a system command, then a relative
                   pathname must be given.  The command search rules will
                   not be followed.

     LOG           Log the specified entity to the specified log file.

     QUIT    (Q)   Same as Exit.

     RECEIVE (R)   Wait for the arrival of a file or file group sent by a
                   Send command from the connected Kermit.

     SEND    (SEN) Sends the specified file to the connected Kermit.

     SERVER  (SER) Places Kermit into server mode.  In server mode, Kermit
                   does not interact directly with the user, but only with
                   the connected Kermit program.

     SET     (SET) Establishes or modifies various parameters for file
                   transfer.

     SHOW    (SH)  Displays the values of the parameters settable by the
                   SET command.

     STATISTICS    Give statistics about the most recent file transfer.

     TAKE    (T)   Executes Kermit commands from the specified file.  The
                   file may contain any valid Kermit commands, including
                   other Take commands.

     TRANSMIT      Send the contents of the specified file to the other
                   system "bare", without protocol, packets, error
                   checking, or retransmission.

     After each command is listed, in parentheses, an abbreviation for the
     command.  For example, to place Kermit into server mode one can enter
     'Server' as the specified command, or they may abbreviate the command
     to 'Ser'.

     The set command recognizes the following parameters :

         BAUD-RATE : Sets the baud-rate to 110, 300, 1200, 4800, 9600, or
                     19200.

         DEBUG     : Turns the debug mode on or off.  In debug mode a file
                     is created in the current working directory.  In that
                     file is maintained a log of all packets which are
                     sent and received along with any state changes that
                     might take place.  Default is off.

         DELAY     : Sets the number of seconds to wait before sending the
                     specified file with a SEND command.  The unit of time
                     is in seconds and must be non-negative.
                     Default is 15.

         ESCAPE    : Sets the character used to escape from CONNECT mode. If
                     GRAPHICS is on, can be any ASCII character (except
                     space). IF GRAPHICS off, must be printable. 
                     Default is ctrl] if graphics on or ! if off.

         ECHO      : Turns the local echo (when in CONNECT mode) on or off.
                     Default is off.

         FILE_TYPE : Sets the type of transmission to handle text or binary
                     files.  If the file type is ascii then only seven
                     bits of each 8-bit data character is used.  If the
                     file type is binary then the full eight bits are used.
                     Default is ascii.

         LINE      : Specifies which line to use when running Kermit as a
                     local Kermit.  Can be 1,2 or 3.

         NAKS      : Turns on or off the sending of periodic NAK's while in
                     server mode.  If this mode is on then approximately
                     every fifteen seconds a NAK is sent to the connected
                     Kermit if no input is received within that time
                     period.  If this mode is off, then there are no NAK's
                     sent on such timeouts.  If the connected Kermit is not
                     capable of clearing its input buffer before beginning
                     the receive file sequence, then this mode should be
                     turned off.  Default is off.

         NORMAL    : If on, names of files sent are converted into a
                     "normal" form before being sent to the connected Kermit
                     and received names are converted into legal Apollo
                     names. If off,no conversion is done. Default is on.

         PARITY    : Sets the parity to ODD, EVEN, or NONE.

         RETRY     : Specifies the number of times a packet should be
                     resent before a transaction should be aborted.
                     Default is 5.

         TIME      : The number of seconds that the connected Kermit is to
                     wait before timing this one out. Must be non-negative.
                     Default is 15.

         TIMEOUT   : The number of seconds that this Kermit is to wait
                     before timing the connected one out. Must be
                     non-negative. This value may be altered when the two
                     Kermits exchange parameters.
                     Default is 60.

         GRAPHICS  : Turns graphics mode on or off. Normally, if you are
                     running KERMIT locally on a normal Apollo display node,
                     KERMIT uses Graphics Primitives to drive the whole screen
                     when CONNECTed or transferring files. These do not work on
                     an attached dumb terminal or on a remote node. If
                     GRAPHICS is switched off, a cruder driver is used. 
                     Not relevant if running as a host.
                     Default is on if you are on a display node, off otherwise.

         RAW       : When CONNECTed, runs screen/line in "raw" mode, i.e. 
                     keystrokes are sent unaltered. If off, works in "cooked"
                     mode, i.e translates Apollo's line terminator (line feed)
                     to the more usual carriage-return. Also filters out most
                     control characters and allows use of backspace, again etc
                     buttons.  Needs to be OFF if you are driving KERMIT on
                     one node from a dumb terminal on another node, or if you
                     switch graphics off.  Not relevant if running as a host.
                     Default on.

         8BIT      : "8 bit quoting" is the method KERMIT uses to send data 
                     which uses all 8 bits on a line where the 8th bit is used
                     for parity.  If 8BIT is on, this KERMIT insists on using
                     quoting. This may cause the other end to abort the
                     transfer. If you are only transferring ASCII text, there
                     is no harm in switching it off.  Default is on.

         Examples  :
                     SET BAUD-RATE 1200       {Sets baud-rate to 1200}
                     SET DEBUG OFF            {Turn debug mode off}
                     SET DEBUG ON             {Turn debug mode on}
                     SET NAKS OFF             {Do not send periodic NAK's}
                     SET NAKS ON              {Send periodic NAK's}
                     SET PARITY EVEN          {Sets parity to even}

     An Apollo process can only drive RS232 ports on its own node. To access
     a port on another node it must be running a Server_Process_Manager. You 
     can then create a remote process on that node by typing:
       CRP -ON nnnn -ME
     Then you can run Kermit on that node. A system manager can make this
     transparent to users by setting /COM/KERMIT on the remote nodes to:

     crp '/com/sh -c //node_nnnn/com/kermit' -on nnnn -me
